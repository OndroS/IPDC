# IPDC
IPDC(InterPlanetary Distributed Computing) is the Distributed Computation service, A peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol to make the computation faster, flexible, and more scalable.

## Abstract
IPDC is a decentralized computing system (or service) built on IPFS.

The traditional [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) is an InterPlanetary distributed file system, users can quickly and easily add their own computers to IPFS environment. After joining IPDC, people can upload their own files (or directory), download, sync ... and so on.

IPFS is actively integrating with [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) with the goal of becoming the storage of the blockchain (Both the core data structure is Merkle Dag).

Even though IPFS looks highly forward-looking, it seems that most people's point of view are purely in terms of storage. However, when a large number of users join the IPFS to contribute storage space, the computing resources of these devices are also very valuable. IPDC hopes to make full use of these computing resources.

IPDC is built on IPFS and communicates with M2M through MQTT technology. IPDC is divided into MR, TF, CL, ER, EM five kinds of architecture currently.
